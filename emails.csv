"Subject: Large Pothole on King Abdulaziz Road – Urgent Action Needed

Location of Visual Pollution:  
King Abdulaziz Road, opposite Al Nakheel Mall, Riyadh

Type and Nature of Visual Pollution:  
I want to report a large and deep pothole on King Abdulaziz Road, right opposite Al Nakheel Mall. The hole is about a meter wide and has been growing larger with time. It's dangerous, especially at night when it’s harder for drivers to notice.

Severity or Impact of the Visual Pollution:  
I’ve seen multiple cars swerve last minute to avoid hitting the pothole, creating a hazardous situation. If this is not fixed soon, I fear it will cause serious accidents, particularly for motorcyclists. This issue is severely impacting the traffic flow in the area as well.
